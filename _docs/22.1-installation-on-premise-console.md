# Installation - On Premise

## Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit - Single machine (on premise)

### Hardware requirements

To install sibylla on your system you need at least:
- 4 core CPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 256 GB of disk space

### Software requirements

To install sibylla on your system you need to install:
- JRE 11 (commercial or open)
- node
- nginx (for running the Sibylla console)

### Console - BackEnd installation & setup

In order to install the WebApp's backend service run the following commands:



- `cd backend`
- `npm install --save`
- `mkdir config`
- `cd config`
- `touch environment.ts`
- `nano/vi/vim environment.ts`

- Copy/paste the following configuration:
```
    export const environment = {
        mongoUrl: "",
        METABASE_SITE_URL: "",
        METABASE_SECRET_KEY: "",
        webGisFolderPath: "",
        webGisWritePath: ""
    };

```

(`webGisFolderPath` is the absolute path to a static folder on the machine, where you will save the KML files. 
`webGisWritePath` is the relative path inside the machine to the same folder.)

Node's default port is `3000`, you can change it by modifying the server.js inside backend/dist/ folder.


- `cd backend`
- `[sudo] npm run prod`

(`CTRL + C` when you will see "Express server listening on port ####")

This will create a `dist` folder with the production-ready code of the backend application.

Now you can either run the app with nohup (npm run prod), or by following the commands down here we will install forever.js, which helps us to keep track of our node services:

- `cd`
- `[sudo] npm install forever -g`
- `[sudo] forever start backend/dist/server.js`


You can check if everything is working correctly by typing:

- `[sudo] forever list`

- Copy the logfile path of your forever.js process retrieved by the above command

- `cat ########.log`

The installation is finished, your application will be hosted on `localhost:3000` or either the port you've specified in the `server.js` file.
